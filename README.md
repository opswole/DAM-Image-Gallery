This project was built as a Proof of Concept during an internship at Hunter Douglas UK. The intention was to build a site comparing Digital Asset Managers that could be used to serve thousands of images in a producation environment. 

While initially built as a .NET MVC site, it was refactored into a headless system with a supporting Next/React front-end to query the API with the AdminLTE bootstrap template for styling.

Essentially the project:
1. Queries the API
2. Returns the images
3. Offers lightbox support for navigating between images individually
4. Offers support for selecting a range of images and downloading them as a .zip

I no longer have access to the API keys, so I am unable to host a demo of the project.
